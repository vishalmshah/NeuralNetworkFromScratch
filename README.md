# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network from Scratch

This is an exercise for me to improve my understanding of how neural networks work.

The purpose of this is to determine the value of a handwritten number.

All data originates from *[this site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html)*, but I used *[this version](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)* as it is easier to work with.
